# Prediction-of-Marks
A simple project based on Linear Regression.

This project makes use of data science. In this project, data has been imported of a set of students, whose marks, and number of hours of study are given. We make a plot to visualise the given data. After splitting the data into training and testing set, we determine a line of best fit for the given data using Linear Regressor. The actual and predicted values are compared and the mean absolute error is evaluated.

We also take user inputs of number of hours of study for a range of students, and predict the number of marks obtained accordingly.
